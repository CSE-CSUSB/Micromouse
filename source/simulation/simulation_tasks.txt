The software simulation part of the Micromouse project are a collection of
programs meant to be executed on a personal computer:

* The maze editor: A graphical program for editing and viewing NxN mazes and 
maze paths. It should be capable of the following:
	* Creating a new maze starting from an empty square of a specified size
	* Importing an existing maze from a CMF file
	* Editing the maze by clicking on the sides of cells to insert or 
	delete walls.
	* Coloring the cells from a list of cell indices specified by the user
	for visualizing a cell path.
	* Exporting the maze to a CMF file.
CMF is the format we will use for storing a maze into a file or string, it is
described in (../documents/common_maze_format.pdf).

* The maze traverser: A command-line program that takes as input CMF data 
and outputs a list of cell indices for traversing the whole maze in the 
shortest path-length possible starting from the Start cell (the last cell 
visited does not need to be the Goal cell).

* The maze pathfinder: A command-line program that takes as input CMF data 
and outputs a list of cell indices for the shortest path from the Start cell
to the Goal cell.

We will be ready to program the bot when we establish what traversing and 
pathfinding algorithms we will use.

I have organized folders with our names which our individual work will go 
into. Make a folder with your last name if one is not present. When we are
ready, we should store our compiled binaries into the same directory as
this text file. The compiled binaries should run on either windows or linux
(or both).

Below this line, write your name and which of these programs you will decide 
to work on at the moment. It is ok for multiple people to work together or 
in competition on the same program.
