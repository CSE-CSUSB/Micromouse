The software simulation part of the Micromouse project are a collection of
programs meant to be executed on a personal computer:

* The maze editor: A graphical program for editing and viewing NxN mazes and 
maze paths. It should be capable of the following:
	* Creating a new maze starting from an empty square of a specified size
	* Importing an existing maze from a CMF file
	* Editing the maze by clicking on the sides of cells to insert or 
	delete walls.
	* Coloring the cells from a list of cell indices specified by the user
	for visualizing a cell path.
	* Exporting the maze to a CMF file.
CMF is the format we will use for storing a maze into a file or string, it is
described in (../documents/common_maze_format.pdf).

* The maze traverser: A command-line program that takes as input CMF data 
and outputs a list of cell indices for traversing the whole maze in the 
shortest path-length possible starting from the Start cell (the last cell 
visited does not need to be the Goal cell).

* The maze pathfinder: A command-line program that takes as input CMF data 
and outputs a list of cell indices for the shortest path from the Start cell
to the Goal cell.

We will be ready to program the bot when we establish what traversing and 
pathfinding algorithms we will use.

Each folder contains the source of a program (such as a maze generator, 
maze editor, maze pathfinder). Name the folder of the program you wish to 
work on to the generic name of that program (such as "maze_traverser" or 
"maze_pathfinder"). If someone else is already working on it, you can either
work together with that person or make your own folder with the same name 
appended with a number (such as "maze_traverser2" or "maze_pathfinder2").

Your programs can use any programming language as long as they're 
cross-platform.
